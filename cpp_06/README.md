**Scalar types

Data types that hold a single value, as opposed to aggregate types like arrays, classes, or structures that can hold multiple values.
Main categories of scalar types:
1. Arithmetic Types
	1.1 Integer Types: Signed(short/int/long/long long) or Unsigned(unsigned short/unsigned int/unsigned long/unsigned long long)
	1.2 Floating-point Types: float/double/long double
2. Character Types
	2.1 Char: Signed char or Unsigned char
	2.2 wchar_t: used for wide characters(larger character sets like Unicode)
	2.3 char16_t and char32_t: used for Unicode characters in UTF-16 and UTF-32 encodings, respectively
3. Boolean Type: bool
4. Pointer Types
	2.1 int*, char*...: These are pointers to specific types
	2.2 void: A generic pointer that can hold the address of any data type
5. Enumerated types (enum)
