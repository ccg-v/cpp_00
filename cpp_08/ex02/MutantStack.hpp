  *	(2) even though std::stack has a protected member c, the compiler cannot
  *		directly access it in C++98, and it does not expose this member directly.
  *		The problem arises because c is protected, and in C++98, this can be
  *		tricky to access through inheritance without more explicit mechanisms.
  *
  *		In C++98, we can still access the underlying container c because it's
  *		protected, but we need to use inheritance carefully and ensure we're
  *		referring to it properly.
  *
  *		Direct Access Through Inheritance: You are inheriting from std::stack,
  *		but the protected member c doesn't become automatically accessible
  *		unless you inherit publicly. Hereâ€™s the corrected code:
  */

/*	(3) The typedef creates an alias for the underlying container's iterator 
 *		type in the MutantStack class. This alias allows us to refer to the
 *		container's iterator type directly as iterator within your class.
 *
 *		- std::stack<T>::container_type: This is the type of the underlying 
 *			container (usually std::deque<T> by default).
 *		- ::iterator: This accesses the iterator type defined within that 
 *			container (std::deque<T>::iterator, for instance).
 *
 *		By defining this typedef in your class, you're effectively saying,
 *		"I want my class to have an iterator type that is the same as the
 *		iterator type of the container inside the stack."
 */

 /*
  *	(4)	Why explicitly expose the iterators but not push(), pop(), size()...?
  *
  *		- Methods like push, pop, top, etc. are part of the std::stack interface,
  *			so when you inherit from std::stack, these methods are directly 
  *			accessible without needing to do anything special.
  *
  *		- Iterators (begin(), end(), etc.) are not part of the std::stack interface,
  *			even though the underlying container has them. Since std::stack hides
  *			the iterators, you need to explicitly expose these in the MutantStack
  *			class to make the stack iterable.
