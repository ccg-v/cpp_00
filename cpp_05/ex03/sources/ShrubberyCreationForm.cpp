/*
 *	(1) Initialization list vs. Copy assignment (*this = source)
 *
 * 	Copy assignment:
 * 
 * 	ShrubberyCreationForm::ShrubberyCreationForm(const ShrubberyCreationForm &source)
 *  	: AForm(source) { 	// Initialize base class
 *   		*this = source; // Use assignment operator to copy
 *   		std::cout << "ShrubberyCreationForm copy constructor called" << std::endl;
 *	}
 *
 * 	Initialization list;
 * 
 * 	ShrubberyCreationForm::ShrubberyCreationForm (const ShrubberyCreationForm & source)
 *		: AForm(source), _target(source._target) {
 *			std::cout << "ShrubberyCreationForm copy constructor called" << std::endl;
 * 
 * 	The copy assignment operator is used to assign values from one already-constructed 
 *	object to another already-constructed object. This process involves:
 *
 *	Existing Object:
 *      The destination object must already be constructed and initialized, but 
 *		potentially with default or previously set values.
 *
 *  Overwriting Values:
 *      The copy assignment operator then overwrites these existing values with the 
 * 		values from the source object. This can lead to intermediate states where
 * 		members are default-initialized or contain old values before they are overwritten.
 * 
 * 	Instead, initialization list initializes members directly when the object is created.
 * 	Thereâ€™s no intermediate state where members are uninitialized or partially initialized.
 * 
 *	The copy assignment operator is not intended for initializing a new object; instead,
 *	it is designed for reassigning an existing object's state. When used correctly, it is
 *	a safe and essential part of managing objects, especially when dealing with dynamic
 *	resources or complex states.

/*
 *	(2) The std::string and char* (C-style strings) represent strings in C++ but in
 *		different ways and with different features. Key differences:
 *
 *		1. Memory Management:
 *
 *		 - std::string manages its own memory, reducing the risk of memory-related errors.
 *    	 - char* requires explicit memory management, increasing the risk of memory-related
 * 				errors.
 *
 *		2. Functionality:
 *
 *		 - std::string has a rich set of member functions for string manipulation.
 *		 - char* relies on C-style string manipulation functions, which are more limited
 *				and prone to errors.
 *
 *		3. Safety:
 *
 *		 - std::string provides bounds checking and automatic memory management, making 
 *				it safer.
 *		 - char* does not provide bounds checking and requires manual memory management, 
 *				making it more error-prone.
