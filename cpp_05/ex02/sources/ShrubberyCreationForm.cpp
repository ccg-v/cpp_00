 * 	Copy assignment:
 * 
 * 	ShrubberyCreationForm::ShrubberyCreationForm(const ShrubberyCreationForm &source)
 *  	: AForm(source) { 	// Initialize base class
 *   		*this = source; // Use assignment operator to copy
 *   		std::cout << "ShrubberyCreationForm copy constructor called" << std::endl;

 * 
 * 	The copy assignment operator is used to assign values from one already-constructed 
 *	object to another already-constructed object. This process involves:
 *
 *	Existing Object:
 *      The destination object must already be constructed and initialized, but 
 *		potentially with default or previously set values.
 *
 *  Overwriting Values:
 *      The copy assignment operator then overwrites these existing values with the 
 * 		values from the source object. This can lead to intermediate states where
 * 		members are default-initialized or contain old values before they are overwritten.
 * 
 * 	Instead, initialization list initializes members directly when the object is created.
 * 	Thereâ€™s no intermediate state where members are uninitialized or partially initialized.
 * 
 *	The copy assignment operator is not intended for initializing a new object; instead,
 *	it is designed for reassigning an existing object's state. When used correctly, it is
 *	a safe and essential part of managing objects, especially when dealing with dynamic
 *	resources or complex states.
