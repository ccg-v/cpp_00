## Key Facts About Binary Search:

1. How Binary Search Works:

- Binary search divides the sequence into halves at each step.
- For a sequence of size *n*, the maximum number of comparisons is $$⌊log⁡_{2}(n)⌋+1$$.
- This is efficient compared to a linear search, which could require nn comparisons.

2. Why $$2^{k}−1$$ is special:

- When the size of the sorted sequence is $$2^{k}−1$$ (where *k* is an integer), the structure of binary search is perfectly balanced:
	- Each level of the search splits the sequence into two equal parts, except at the final step.
	- The search depth and the number of comparisons are minimal and predictable.

## Comparison Efficiency and Power-of-Two Alignment:

The efficiency of binary search holds across a range of sequence sizes, but sequences with sizes near $$2^{k}−1$$ provide consistent comparison counts for specific ranges.

Example:

- For $$2^{3}−1=7$$:
	- If the sequence size is **7**, binary search will take:
    	- **At most 3 comparisons**.
	- For sequences slightly larger (e.g., size 8 to 15), the maximum number of comparisons is still 4:
        - **Range**: [$$2_{k}−1, 2^{k+1}−1$$], i.e., [7,15].
        - **Maximum comparisons**: $$⌊log^{⁡2}(15)⌋+1=4$$.

## Implications for Ford-Johnson Algorithm:

The Ford-Johnson algorithm relies on:

1. Insertion Points Determined by Jacobsthal Numbers:
	- Jacobsthal indices ensure that pending values are inserted at the most efficient positions.

2. Balanced Sequence Growth:
    - By maintaining the sorted sequence size near $$2^{k}−1$$, the algorithm ensures the minimal number of comparisons for inserting new elements.

3. Dynamic Alternation Between Pending and Larger Values:
    - Larger values are appended to stabilize the sequence size, while pending values are inserted strategically to maintain balance.

## Summary:

- Binary search works "optimally" near $$2^{k}−1$$ because:

    - It splits the sequence into halves efficiently.
    - The number of comparisons remains consistent across a predictable range.

- In Ford-Johnson, this property reduces the number of comparisons, aligning with the algorithm’s goal of minimizing computational cost.
